LEGEND SEEKER, is an app that takes the user input(an age) and looks for a legend that died at the age the user inputed
The app denies every non Integer entries and prompts the user to try again,for now the app only keeps record of 10 Legends but in further updates more of them will be added it also only accepts entries that are between 20 and 99 years old,this was just a quick overview of the app in the link below you'll find a more detail report of what the app does and a video that showcases it.
Thank you and I hope you'll enjoy it.
